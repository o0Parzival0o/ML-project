The project focused on building a mlp neural network from scratch, using only simple numerical libraries. It has a variety of hyperparameters that can be tuned, different early stopping methods, and supports hold out and k fold cv for both selection and assessment. We first did a coarse grid search to know which parameters bound to exclude, then a finer grid search and finally a finer random search. the original cup dataset was split on 80% tr+vl, 20%ts. Grid search used hold out for speed, random search used k fold cv selection for accuracy. Model is retrained after selection and assessment. The model has 12 input units, hidden layer in the shape [44,41,48] and 4 output units
